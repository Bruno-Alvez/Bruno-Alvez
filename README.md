# Bruno Alves

Software Engineer. Backend, integrations and product systems. Python, Go, Node.js and AWS.

I design and deliver systems end-to-end. Most of my work is backend-heavy, but I also ship full product slices when needed, from API to UI and deployment. I build reliable integrations, async processing pipelines, and LLM-enabled automation with governance and traceability.

## What you can expect in my work

- Production-grade APIs and services with clear contracts and predictable behavior  
- Async processing with workers and queues for sync, enrichment and long-running workflows  
- Reliability for external dependencies: rate limiting, retries with backoff, timeouts, idempotency  
- Data modeling and performance on PostgreSQL, Redis and Supabase  
- Observability and operations: structured logs, metrics, tracing, incident troubleshooting  
- LLM components constrained by schemas, with auditability and operational controls  

## Selected work

- **FAMATH Enrollment Ecosystem**: Admin backoffice, student portal, WhatsApp LLM agent, payments and legacy sync  
- **Fintech CRM with AI Lead Qualification**: WhatsApp ingestion, stage-based qualification, round-robin assignment, real-time Kanban updates
- **DRE Engine**: Multi-tenant financial platform with rule versioning and consistency controls  
- **OpsForge** (public): Observability and webhook delivery platform in Go
