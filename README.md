# Bruno Alves

Software Engineer (Backend & AI Systems) with experience designing and delivering production systems involving backend architecture, distributed processing, workflow automation and LLM-integrated components. I work end-to-end across design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, always optimizing for clarity, reliability and measurable business impact.

## Professional Summary

I build backend systems where correctness, predictable behavior and operational resilience matter. My work spans:

- deterministic LLM-integrated components used in real workflows  
- distributed backend services using Fastify, FastAPI, Prisma and PostgreSQL  
- real-time features built with SSE, queues and event-driven pipelines  
- workflow automation across multiple external systems  
- maintainable service/repository architectures with explicit domain boundaries  

I follow an engineering-first mindset: simple designs, explicit contracts, consistent data models and code that remains understandable and operable over time.
