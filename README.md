# Bruno Alves

AI & Software Engineer with experience designing and shipping production systems involving backend architecture, intelligent automation, and LLM-powered agents. I work end-to-end across design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, always optimizing for clarity, reliability and measurable business impact.

## Professional Summary

I build systems where correctness, predictable behavior and operational resilience matter. My work spans:

- deterministic LLM-based agents for real workflows  
- distributed backend services with Fastify, FastAPI, Prisma and PostgreSQL  
- real-time features powered by SSE and event-driven pipelines  
- workflow automation across multiple external systems  
- structured, maintainable architectures built around services and repositories  

I adopt an engineering-first mindset: simple designs, explicit boundaries, consistent data models, and code that remains understandable years later.
